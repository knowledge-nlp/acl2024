								<b>Title: </b> The super alignment of of large language models <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 9:10 - 9:50 am <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> With the rapid development of large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, artificial general intelligence is getting closer and closer. But “the more intelligent AI is, the more dangerous it is.”, it becomes more and more crucial for us to make sure LLMs are really aligned and safe for our societies. In this talk, the speaker will talk about the  super alignment technologies to the super intelligence, including the alignment algorithms, training-free model extrapolation, and a conceptual framework for auto refinement. He will talk about weak-to-strong generalization, scalable oversight, auto red-teaming, exact optimization algorithm for alignment, and so on.  <br>

								<b>Title: </b> Reliable, Adaptable and Attributable Language Models, Powered by Knowledge <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 9:50 - 10:30 am <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> Large language models (LLMs), trained on extensive web data, demonstrate impressive flexibility and capability. Nevertheless, they continue to face practical challenges, including hallucinations, difficulties in adapting to new data distributions, and a lack of verifiability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a popular approach to leveraging knowledge, which helps LLMs mitigate these weaknesses to some extent. However, RAG still falls short of providing a comprehensive solution to these problems. In this talk, I will discuss our recent efforts to enhance the factual accuracy and faithfulness of LLMs to the knowledge provided by retrieval. This includes an overview of how we can automatically evaluate the factuality of LLM responses and encourage LLMs to rely more heavily on explicit knowledge when generating responses. Furthermore, I will introduce a novel, efficient semi-parametric language model designed to reduce hallucinations and provide more attribution to their generations. Finally, I will conclude by discussing key open problems and outlining our planned approaches to addressing them in the near future. <br>

								<b>Title: </b> Improving the Reliability of LLMs in Socially-Oriented Knowledge-Intensive Tasks <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 11:20 - 11:55 am <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> LLMs excel at encoding real-world knowledge and using it for knowledge-intensive tasks. In socially-oriented domains, however, they often resort to hallucinations when the knowledge is implicit, subjective, or evolving. In this talk, I'll propose new directions to improve the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes, socially-oriented, knowledge-intensive tasks: (1) methods to abstain from generating a response when the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient, and (2) methods to adapt the LLM's knowledge at decoding time and controllably steer it towards informative and more reliable outputs. I'll conclude with a discussion of future directions aimed at empowering LLMs to offer reliable responses on realistically complex, controversial, and socially-sensitive topics. <br>

								<b>Title: </b> Soft Reasoning for Factual LLMs <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 11:55 - 12:30 pm <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> When we ask LLMs questions, we expect them to not just retrieve information, but to synthesize it and explain it to us in a long-form answer. The prevalence of hallucinations and similar mistakes shows that LLMs still fall short at doing this correctly. In limited domains such as mathematical reasoning, “hard” formal reasoners can enforce correctness. However, in “soft reasoning” settings like open-ended question answering, no such tools exist. In this talk, I will argue that LLMs can improve their own soft reasoning if we leverage the right data. I will discuss our work on two key problems: how to ensure LLM outputs are factually grounded in inputs and how to build deductive reasoners over natural language. First, I will describe a series of textual entailment systems that can detect hallucinations from language models. We have found that small language models trained on synthetic data can match the performance of frontier LLMs and outperform approaches encoding linguistic priors. Second, I will discuss work on entailment trees, structures connecting natural language premise statements to derived conclusions. I will describe a challenging new benchmark dataset, MuSR, and show how fine-tuning can elevate LLM correctness beyond chain-of-thought. <br>

								<b>Title: </b> Temporal Dynamics of Language Model Retraining <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 2:00 - 2:40 pm <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> Many researchers have experienced the difficulty of injecting new knowledge or adapting to a new language (e.g. Korean) during language model (LM) post-training (finetuning). This is rather weird because pretraining and post-training are both just gradient descents with next token prediction loss. A plausible hypothesis is that the “learnability” of an LM is a function of time. In this talk, I will discuss our recent effort on answering this research question by analyzing OLMo checkpoints, and how the results align with recent findings in other works. It is worth noting that if the hypothesis is true, it could mean the scope of what an LM can do through post-training is inherently limited, and the significance of being able to pretrain an LM from scratch could be much bigger than how it is generally perceived. <br>

								<b>Title: </b> Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities <br>
								<b>Time: </b> 3:30 - 4:10 pm <br>
								<b>Abstract: </b> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for applications such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation, the security of these systems becomes crucial. This talk delves into the vulnerabilities of LLM-based multi-agent communities to the spread of manipulated world knowledge. We explore how attackers can inject counterfactual or toxic knowledge into a single agent, leading to the unintentional propagation of this misinformation throughout the whole community. Due to LLMs' inherent vulnerability in recognizing and understanding world knowledge, they are prone to accepting manipulated information as true if given plausible evidence. Our findings demonstrate that even subtle manipulations can lead multi-agent communities to adopt false beliefs, such as convincing them that "the Earth is made of strawberries," without explicit prompt manipulation. We emphasize the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure the reliability of knowledge shared among LLM-based agents and provide future directions in securing these systems against malicious manipulation. <br>
